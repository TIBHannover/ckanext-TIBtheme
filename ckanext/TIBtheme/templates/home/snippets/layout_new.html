    <p>
    The TIB Data Manager prototype was developed to support the aspect of better re-usability of research data. The prototype supports the management and access to heterogeneous research data publications and assists researchers in the selection of relevant data sets for their respective disciplines.

    <p>
      The prototype currently offers the following functions for the visualization of research data:
      <br>

      <br>
      ·         Different views on the same data set (2D and 3D support).
      <br>
      ·         Visualization of Auto CAD files.
      <br>
      ·         Jupyter Notes for demonstrating live code.
